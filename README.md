# Installation:

it doesn't have a config file (for now), but you can configure the format of the video, sound devices, video devices, webcam and more in the shell script file.

### note from author
this shit is a shame<br>
made this wrapper for personal use only, but i decided to make it public thinking that works (but i found smth around 5-10 bugs). <br>
feel free to modify whatever lines you want and study with this, and it's not necessary to give the credits if distribute (really, it is not, don't give credits, please)
