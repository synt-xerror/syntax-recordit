### note from author
i know that logo looks awful. <br>
made this wrapper for personal use only, but i decided to make it public for my portfolio. <br>
feel free to modify whatever lines you want and study with this, and it's not necessary to give the credits if distribute (but... i'll be happy if you do :D)
